# MNI_open_data

The folder MNI_open_data is a place for me to share some analysis and visualization that I've done using data from the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) Open Research portal.
The MNI is the first open science institution in the world. You can read more about their vision, platform at policies at: https://mniopenresearch.org/
I have no affiliation with the MNI. Any mistakes you find are my mistakes and should be addressed to me personally.

MIST exploratory analysis and visualization:
   - Using data from the article: https://mniopenresearch.org/articles/1-3/v1
   - MIST_analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook (Python script) with a basic exploratory analysis of the data in the paper, along with some processing steps to generate the .csv and .txt files used in the Processing sketch.
   - functional_network_visualization.pde: A processing sketch used to load data exported from the Python analysis script, and to visualize a random walk through related functional networks of the human brain. PDE File must be in a folder of your Processing sketches folder with the same name as the .pde file: functional_network_visualization, and it must contain a 'data' folder with the exported files from the Jupyter notebook.
